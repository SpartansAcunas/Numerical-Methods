# MATLAB Program for Controlling Overflow in a Cylindrical Tank with a Conical Base

## Introduction

This MATLAB program is designed to prevent an overflow situation in a cylindrical tank with a conical base. The program calculates the volume of the liquid inside the tank and checks if it exceeds a certain height limit, in this case, 3R. If the liquid level surpasses this limit, the program indicates an error. Otherwise, it displays the calculated volume.
