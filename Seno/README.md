# MATLAB Script for Calculating sen(x)

## Introduction

This MATLAB script calculates the value of `sen(x)` using a series expansion. It provides an algorithm that approximates the sine function and calculates the relative error. The script takes user inputs for the maximum exponent 'n' and the value of 'x'.
