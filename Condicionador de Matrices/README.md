# Condition of Matrices

In the field of numerical analysis, it's essential to understand the concept of matrix condition. A matrix is considered "poorly conditioned" when small changes in its coefficients lead to significant changes in the solution. Another way to look at poor conditioning is that a broad range of results can only approximately satisfy the equations. This sensitivity to round-off errors can result in substantial inaccuracies when solving poorly conditioned systems.

## MATLAB Program for Matrix Condition

To help determine whether a given matrix is well-conditioned or poorly conditioned, we have created a MATLAB program. This program allows users to assess the condition of a matrix of any size. Each step within the program is documented to provide clarity on the procedure being executed.

To use the program, you can follow these steps:

1. Define or input the matrix you want to evaluate within the MATLAB environment.
2. Copy and paste the provided MATLAB code into the Command Window.
3. Run the program to determine whether the matrix is well-conditioned or poorly conditioned based on the specified criteria.

By following these steps, you can quickly assess the condition of a matrix and determine whether it is suitable for numerical computations.
